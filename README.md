# Python-Second-Checkpoint
Objective
In this checkpoint, we are going to manipulate lists, dictionaries and tuples. So letâ€™s get started

Instructions
Question1: 

Write a Python program to multiplies all the items in a list.

for example list=[2, 3, 6]

result = 36

Question2

Write a Python program to combine two dictionary adding values for common keys.

d1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c':300}

d2 = {'a': 300, 'b': 200, 'd':400}

Expected output: {'a': 400, 'b': 400, 'd': 400, 'c': 300}

Question 3

Question: With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
